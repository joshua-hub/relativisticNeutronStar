Q1
Is there a maximum mass in each sequence? Speculate as to what you think might
be causing this.

From the initial epsilon vaules of 4.2*B to 20*B, there doesn't appear to be a 
limit to the mass for the non-relativistic solution and there does appear to be
a limit to the relativistic solution. This would occur because in GR, the 
inward pull of gravity would be greater because of the higher energy density.
The non-relativistic version accounts only for mass, and not energy as well.

During developing my code, I had the wrong step size (4.4B instead of 0.2B).
This meant that my steps went up to around 350*B. In this plot, both of 
the plots had a turning point. After I corrected my code, I also reproduced 
this by taking the correct step size, but continuing up to 350B. The solution 
for this now had a smooth turning point. I would guess that this was because 
the values of initial epsilon started were outside of the valid model.


Q2
What does the relationship between M and R appear to be for small 
epsilon_nought? Discuss.

For assessing this question, I set the xrange on the plot and replotted so that
the information for small epsilon was more easily seen. I also started solving 
analytically and the slope of M as a function of R should decrease as R goes to 
zero, but dm/dr is a function of r and epsilon, so the equation will not be 
exactly quadratic.
